This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.


<h2>Context</h2>

<p>
  As the modern workplace continues to transform, remote work has become more important than
  ever. Whether you end up working in an office or from home, it's crucial that you know how to
  communicate and collaborate effectively.
</p>

<p>
  In this Achievement, I'll learn how to work with others by writing and sharing documentation with
  my peers, providing feedback, and making a contribution to the tech community. The ability to create
  detailed and straightforward handoffs for other developers is an indispensable skill that I'll need
  when applying for a job.
</p>

<p>
  Opportunities to engage with these skills will be provided by my Achievement 6 project. For my
  project, I'll return to the myFlix app's server-side from Achievement 2 and build the client-side
  interface for a new single-page, responsive app, one that includes several interface views that will
  handle data through the previously-defined REST API endpoints.
</p>

<p>
  This time I'll use Angular, instead of React. Angular is an extremely popular framework that can be
  used for a wide range of mobile and desktop applications. It's particularly well-suited to large projects,
  as well as projects requiring a complex user interface because it comes with a variety of built-in
  modules and services.
</p>

<p>
  As I work on this project, I’ll use Agile project management techniques including user stories,
  story points, and a kanban board. These techniques are commonly used by companies in the tech
  industry. At the same time, I'll practice communicating the skills and knowledge that I'm
  acquiring with technical interview questions, before adding the project to, and finalizing, my online
  portfolio.
</p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>

<ul>
  <li>As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
      can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The app should display a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an account</li>
  <li>Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies</li>
  <li>Upon clicking on a particular movie, users will be taken to a single movie view, where
      additional movie details will be displayed. The single movie view will contain the following
      additional features:
  <ul>
      <li>A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view, where details about the
          director of that particular movie will be displayed</li>
      <li>A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view, where details about that
          particular genre of the movie will be displayed</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>The 5 W's</h2>

<ol type="1">
  <li><em>Who </em>—The users of the myFlix movie app and codebase, including other developers and designers</li>
  <li><em>What </em>—A single-page, responsive movie app built with Angular, with routing and several
                    interface views. The client-side developed in this Achievement will support the existing
                    server-side from Achievement 2 by facilitating user requests and rendering the response from
                    the server-side via a number of different interface views. The app will be accompanied by
                    relevant documentation and handoff deliverables, including a kanban board containing user
                    stories and story points</li>
  <li><em>When </em>—Users will be able to use the app whenever they want to read information about
                    different movies or update their user information</li>
  <li><em>Where </em>—The app will be hosted online. It is responsive and can therefore be used anywhere
                     and on any device, giving all users an equal experience</li>
  <li><em>Why </em>—Movie enthusiasts like to be able to access information about different movies,
                    directors, and genres whenever they want. The app will demonstrate your Angular skills and
                    your ability to create straightforward documentation for other developers and employers</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The application must be written in Angular (version 9 or later)</li>
  <li>The application requires the latest version of Node.js and npm package</li>
  <li>The application must contain user registration and login forms</li>
  <li>The application must be designed using Angular Material</li>
  <li>The application's codebase must contain comments using Typedoc</li>
  <li>The project must contain technical documentation using JSDoc</li>
  <li>The project must be hosted on GitHub Pages</li>
  
</ul>
